Three separate projects for Pragmatic Studio Ruby Course.
* Movie.rb is follow along code (so none of it is my code)
* Crowdfund.rb is completely my code
* Studio_game.rb is my code but with the ability to check a reference sheet to make sure my code is correct
* Any other files are just tests but my code
